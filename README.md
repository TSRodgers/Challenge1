This module challenge was a code refractor where we were giving starter code and tasked with "fixing" the code and making it more accessible as well as refining it.

I started with first fixing the semantic tags in the html by changing select <div> tags to section, aside, header, footer, etc. tags depending on what best fit the content of the section. I then added alt tags to the images that needed them, describing the image in detail without using the words picture or image. I then transitioned to streamlining and de-cluttering the css of this webpage. There were many style selections that were re used, to fix this I applied classes to sections on the html page so that I could apply one style selection to several html elements rather than applying the same style several times. After decluttering the css selections I then group them by the area of the page they applied to and seperated them with comments so that you can more easily tell what the styles are applied to. I then applied a title to the html page so that the browser will display "Horiseon" on the tab rather than "webpage". After these changes I beleive I have streamlined and fixed the source code to the best of my ability, I then pushed the repo to github for the final time and submitted my work.
